      "content": "New to the series, the Sims display a range of emotions which influence your variety of decisions in the game. Emotions give you new choices that impact your Sims and shape their stories. You can now control how your Sims engage other Sims, objects and individual moments in the game. You control the brain, corpus, and now the heart of your Sims. The Sims you generate are full of life and are defined by, among other things, their unique personalities and their varying emotions.",
